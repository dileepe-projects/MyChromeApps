Version 0.1

1. The app uses indexed DB of the browser. Yet to test the capacity of database.
2. No export or delete database options enabled. Still working on it.
3. UI: bootstrap, jquery-ui for datepicker, jquery-ui-timepicker-addon for timepicker
4. Used external js libraries like moment-with-locales for converting date/time so as to make it comparable.
